# WhisperHub

### A **masked** micro-blogging social media service 🎭

WhisperHub is a open-source micro-blogging service written in typescript. This is more than just one.

## Anonymous User

In WhisperHub, you don't have to set your user's name. All posts are published without user's name. It's like 2ch, a Japanese BBS.

See [Wiki (In Japanese)](https://wiki.citringo.net/doku.php?id=whisperhub) to get more information.
